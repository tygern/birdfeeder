                      "text": "________________________\nAsbury Park Convention Hall | Asbury Park, New Jersey | c. 1930\n\u2022\nAsbury Park Convention Hall is a 3,600-seat indoor exhibition center located on the boardwalk and beach in Asbury Park, New Jersey, in the United States. Built between 1928 and 1930, the complex is used for sports, concerts and other special events\n\u2022\nIn 1916, Asbury Park Mayor Clarence E.F. Hetrick hired famed architectural firm McKim, Mead and White to design a convention center for the block just north of the city's Atlantic Square. However, city founder James A. Bradley owned the block in question, then home to the aging Asbury Park Auditorium, and refused to sell the plot to the city - so plans were stalled\n\u2022\nPressure increased for Hetrick to construct a considerable structure after the completion of Madison Square Garden in New York City, and the approval of Atlantic City's new Convention Hall. So in 1927, after a mysterious fire destroyed the 5th Avenue Arcade just east of Atlantic Square on the Boardwalk, plans were revised and voters passed a bond referendum to construct a new convention center on the plot\n\u2022\nHetrick commissioned architects Warren and Wetmore - who also designed New York City's Grand Central Terminal - to complete the task at hand. The firm's eventual design called for a 1,600-seat theatre to occupy the plot\n\u2022\nOver the years the Convention Hall has played host to many events and concerts, including some of the biggest Rock and roll acts in the world. The location was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and the New Jersey Register of Historic Places and continues in operation today\n\u2022\n\ud83d\udcf8: @opalandjayephoto\n\u270d: @wikipedia\n\u2022\n#Cookingforbirds #WesAnderson #VscoArchitecture #Vsco #TravelMore #AccidentalWesAnderson #EmptySeats #EmptyStadium #NJIsntBoring #AsburyPark #DiscoverNJ #YesNJ #VisitNJ #AsburyParkNow"

                      "text": "________________________\nYuma Building | San Diego, California | c. 1869\n\u2022\nThe Yuma Building is located in the downtown Gaslamp Quarter of San Diego, California. The structure was built by Capt. Alfred Henry Wilcox in 1869 and was one of downtown\u2019s first brick buildings\n\u2022\nWilcox came to San Diego in 1849 on The Invincible - a 120-ton schooner used by the U.S. Army as a transport ship. While he was never famously known for captaining the cruiser, the Invincible was notable for bringing an engineering crew to construct the first dam in an effort to turn the San Diego River into a false bay\n\u2022\nLike many Downtown historic buildings, the Yuma was initially constructed as a one-story structure. Brick-laying began one year before the death of Wilcox, and the building was named in reference to Capt. Wilcox\u2019s experiences in that location along the Colorado River\n\u2022\nIn 1912 the building earned dubious distinction as the first to be closed during a sweep of the red light district and a round-up of the \u201cladies of the night\u201d. This building, along with the Louis Bank of Commerce located at 835 to 837 Fifth Avenue, is one of the Gaslamp Quarter\u2019s most photographed and recognizable iconic structures\n\u2022\nKnow more?

It was built in the 1950s by the parents of the current owners, the Complojer family\n\u2022\nThe area of South Tyrol is one of the wealthiest regions in Italy and Europe. It is mostly known for its unique mountain landscape which attracts a vast number of tourists every year. Tourism in this area was only established recently however, and took a steady pace to slowly reach its peak. For a long time, the Alps were only an unwelcome obstacle on the journey to the sunny Italian beaches. Around 1800, when the South Tyrolean Andreas Hofer led an uprising against Napoleon, the region became known all around Europe for the first time\n\u2022\nIn the 1930s, the first cable cars, restaurants and mountain hotels were built and tourism began to slowly trickle in. Mass tourism did not begin in the region until after the First World War when South Tyrol became part of Italy and the Italians came in flocks to visit the area\n\u2022\nThe family owned hotel was not established until after the Second World War, during a very difficult time for the South Tyrolean people. Much of the local community was impoverished at the time and had emigrated from their home town\n\u2022\nThe face of the area changed even more when skiing became popular and more tourism began to arrive. New cable cars and skiing areas were established, and the current owners\u2019 parents opened the hotel with only 10 rooms, each boasting running hot and cold water. Over the years, the rooms have been updated, and new ones were added while keeping the memory and utilizing original materials from the first years. Additional amenities were also added, including a the bowling alley seen here bowling\n\u2022\n\ud83d\udcf8: @sarahisle \u270d: @wikipedia + riposoalbosco.it\n\u2022\n#Cookingforbirds #WesAnderson #VscoArchitecture #Vsco #TravelMore #AccidentalWesAnderson #RiposoalBosco #SanVigiliodiMarebbe #SouthTyrol #Italy\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9"

                      "text": "________________________\nArt Institute of Chicago | Chicago, Illinois | c. 1879\n\u2022\nThe Art Institute of Chicago was founded as the both a museum and school for the fine arts in 1879. Originally named the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts, the name was changed in 1882, and within a decade, the rapidly growing collection and student body initiated the need for a new home\n\u2022\nAs the city prepared to host of the 1893 World\u2019s Columbian Exposition, the Art Institute\u2019s trustees negotiated with the city\u2019s civic bodies for a new structure on a park site at Michigan Avenue and Adams Street\n\u2022\nBy 1916, expansion of the museum was again required to suitably display a collection that now included nearly every artistic medium. The bold solution was to build over the Illinois Central Railroad tracks that bordered the Art Institute\u2019s east wall. Additions for both the school and museum were added and included memorials to two young men who died in World War I: the George Alexander McKinlock Jr. Memorial Court (in 1924) and the Kenneth Sawyer Goodman Theater (in 1925)\n\u2022\nThe current building is a classical Beaux-Arts building, by Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge of Boston, Massachusetts. Composed of 273 galleries that total 562,000 square feet (52,200 m2), the structure has a grand Italian Renaissance facade with a pedimented 5-bayed central section that protrudes forward from the 7-bayed wings on either side. The arcaded entry loggia is topped by three grand palladian arches that are separated by Corinthian half-columns\n\u2022\nThe permanent collection has grown from plaster casts to nearly 300,000 works of art in fields ranging from Chinese bronzes to contemporary design and from textiles to installation art. Together, the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and the museum of the Art Institute of Chicago are now internationally recognized as two of the leading fine-arts institutions in the United States\n\u2022\n\ud83d\udcf8: @maren.robinson\n\u270d: @wikipedia + @artinstitutechi\n\u2022\n#Cookingforbirds #WesAnderson #VscoArchitecture #Vsco #TravelMore #AccidentalWesAnderson #ArtInstituteChi #ArtInstituteofChicago #Chicago #Illinois"

It is located in Westkapelle, a small city on the island Walcheren, in the province Zeeland of the Netherlands with a population of less than 3,000 full time residents\n\u2022\nDesigned in 1875 by Quirinus Harder - a Dutch architect best known for having designed a large number of lighthouses in the late 1800s - Lighthouse Noorderhoofd was constructed using a main 6000 candela light that flashes every 10 seconds with a visibility range of up to 13 nautical miles\n\u2022\nMaking the segments for this round tower was more difficult than for an angular tower. The iron foundry Nering B\u00f6gel in Deventer took on the task of creating wooden molds by hand from which the circular iron was cast\n\u2022\nAt the foot of the tower there was a stone building that in use by the Coast Guard until 1995. Built in the 1960s, the shelter fell into disrepair and was the target of vandalism, so eventually was demolished\n\u2022\nThe Noorderhoofd is actually the second active lighthouse in Westkapelle. The other is known as the \u2018Tall Lighthouse\u2019, was built between at the entrance to the village, and is actually the remainder of a church that burned down in the 18th century. In 1818 a light was added to the top. Together the two lights lead vessels coming from the North Sea into the narrow and busy shipping lane directly under the south west coast of Walcheren\n\u2022\nThe lighthouse is located just behind the seawall at Westkapelle and is open to the public to climb\n\u2022\nKnow more?

The railway between Malm\u00f6 and Limhamn had been laid a bit into the low water - puddles would form, the seaweed would get caught and the smell would spread over the western parts of Malm\u00f6. To remedy this, a proposal was drawn for a boardwalk by city gardener Wollf in 1890. In connection with the work of the Palace Park, Edward Glaesel in 1899 made a more elegant proposal: for a beach promenade, ie the current \u00d6resund park, which was not completed until 1924\n\u2022\nThe beach is equipped with a total of 10 bathing piers - the most famous being that of  Kallbadhus Ribersborg. At the end of a broad pier is the bath house, built in 1898 it was purchased by the City of Malm\u00f6 in 1966, and declared a historic building in 1995 before undergoing a full restoration in 2009\n\u2022\nThe entire recreational area extends from the new district V\u00e4stra hamn along the coast up to Limhamn. Walking and biking paths lead through the spacious lawns behind the beach and there are several playgrounds for football, rugby and American football. At the end of the beach, between the last bathing bridge and a marina, there is a beach section for nude bathers\n\u2022\n\ud83d\udcf8: @ciro_bossa\n\u270d: @wikipedia + guidebook-sweden.com + malmo.se\n\u2022\n#Cookingforbirds #WesAnderson #VscoArchitecture #Vsco #TravelMore #AccidentalWesAnderson #Malmo #Sweden #Ribersborgsstrand"

It broke up the industrial look of the city with its art-nouveau facade of wrought iron and tiles. Its unique design has made it one of the architectural gems of the town, and a point of interest all its own in Bilbao\n\u2022\nDesigned by the engineer Valent\u00edn Gorbe\u00f1a and architect Severino Ach\u00facarro who collaborated in the Ensanche Plan in 1876, the station is used by Renfe Feve, part of Spain's national Renfe line, which has trains running west into Cantabria\n\u2022\nIn 2007, the station went through a significant restoration and refurbishment, adapting it to modern traffic and current regulations. It is also now outfitted to host social events, concerts and presentations at its facilities\n\u2022\n\ud83d\udcf8: @abbieaadams\n\u270d: @wikipedia + @lonelyplanet\n\u2022\n#Cookingforbirds #WesAnderson #VscoArchitecture #Vsco #TravelMore #AccidentalWesAnderson #ConcordiaStation #BilbaoConcordiaStation #RenfeFeve #Bilbao #Spain"

Built in 1844 and designed by architect Edward Brickell White, it is the oldest Gothic Revival church in South Carolina\n\u2022\nIn April of 1680 the ship \u2018Richmond\u2019 arrived in Charleston with 45 French Protestants (Huguenots) aboard. More refugees followed, and in 1687, a church was built on what is now the corner of Church St. and Queen St. in downtown Charleston. About four hundred and fifty Huguenots had settled in the Low Country of South Carolina by 1700\n\u2022\nThe original church was destroyed in 1796, and while a replacement for the original building was completed in 1800, it was dismantled in 1844 to make way for the present Gothic Revival edifice, designed by Edward Brickell White and dedicated in 1845\n\u2022\nThe church boasts a varied congregation made up of young individuals, families with children, as well as mid-life and senior members. Although there are members who are descendants of French Huguenot families, being of Huguenot descent is not a requirement for membership and all are welcome\n\u2022\nIn 1973, the church was designated a National Historic Landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Today, services still follow 18th century French liturgy, but are conducted in English except once per year\n\u2022\n\ud83d\udcf8: @cambronelsey \u270d: @wikipedia + huguenot-church.org\n\u2022\n#Cookingforbirds #WesAnderson #VscoArchitecture #Vsco #TravelMore #ExploreCharleston #AccidentalWesAnderson #Charleston #SouthCarolina #HuguenotChurch"

The entire town including the hotel, is situated in Banff National Park, a national park managed by Parks Canada\n\u2022\nBy the start of the twentieth century, the hotel had developed into one of the top three mountain getaways in North America. To help adapt to the rise of international guests, the hotel underwent two upgrade periods. Between 1900 to 1910, all adjustments to the original structure of the hotel were completed. From 1910 to 1928, all changes were aimed at the completion of a 'new' hotel\n\u2022\nUnfortunately in 1926 the original wooden hotel burnt down. It was rebuilt larger and in its present appearance, and within the 28-year rebuilding period, the hotel rarely saw a year without some form of addition or improvement\n\u2022\n1968, the building underwent a process of winterization, allowing for the hotel to operate year-round. Several rounds of additional renovations took place during the latter half of the 20th century, including one in 1971, and another in preparation for the 1988 Winter Olympics\n\u2022\nThe hotel was named for William Davidson, who had grown up close to Banff, Scotland, and was the first European settler in that area of Canada. The name borne by the Canadian city and the national park is derived from his native country. Halfway up the internal staircase closest to the Bow Falls is a painting of Davidson felling trees on the Miramichi River during colonial times\n\u2022\n\ud83d\udcf8: @star.babyyy \u270d: @wikipedia + @fairmontbanff\n\u2022\n#Cookingforbirds #WesAnderson #VscoArchitecture #Vsco #TravelMore #TravelAlberta #AccidentalWesAnderson #BanffSpringsHotel #Banff #Alberta #Canada\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6"

Founded in 1670 as a physic garden to grow medicinal plants, today it occupies four sites across Scotland \u2014 Edinburgh, Dawyck, Logan and Benmore \u2014 each with its own specialist collection\n\u2022\nThe Edinburgh botanic garden is the second oldest botanic garden in Britain after Oxford's. The plant collection used as the basis of the garden was the private collection of Sir Patrick Murray, 2nd Lord Elibank, which was moved from his home at Livingston Peel in 1672\n\u2022\nThe collection of plants expanded with the British Empire. In 1763, the garden's collections were moved away from the city's pollution to a larger \"Physic Garden\" on the west side of Leith Walk, as shown in Ainslie's 1804 map. A cottage from the garden's original site remained on Leith Walk for over one hundred years. In 2008, the building was moved brick by brick to a site within the current gardens. The project was completed in 2016\n\u2022\nToday, RBGE has a plant collection of 13,500 species in its 116 hectares of Garden. It has more than 3 million Herbarium Specimens and welcomes over one million visitors each year \u2022\nKnow more?

At 1,805 km2 (697 sq mi), it is the second largest national park in Atlantic Canada, surpassed only by Torngat Mountains National Park, which is 9,700 km2 (3,700 sq mi)\n\u2022\nThe park takes its name from Newfoundland's second-highest mountain peak (at 806 m or 2,644 ft) located within the park. Its French meaning is \"large mountain standing alone,\" or more literally \"great sombre.\" Gros Morne is a member of the Long Range Mountains, an outlying range of the Appalachian Mountains, stretching the length of the island's west coast\n\u2022\nOne area of the park known as the Tablelands is an area in between the towns of Trout River and Woody Point which is thought to have originated in the Earth's mantle and was forced up from the depths during a plate collision several hundred million years ago\n\u2022\nIn 1987, the park was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site for both its geological history and its exceptional scenery. The geology of the park in particular illustrates the concept of plate tectonics, and has shed important light on geological evolution and its processes\n\u2022\n\ud83d\udcf7: @jackiecole_ \u270d: @wikipedia + pc.gc.ca + newfoundlanabrador.com\n\u2022\n#Cookingforbirds #WesAnderson #VscoArchitecture #Vsco #TravelMore #AccidentalWesAnderson #GrosMorne #Tablelands #GrosMorneNationalPark #NationalParkOfCanada #Newfoundland #Canada\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6"
